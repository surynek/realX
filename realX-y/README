=======================================================

An experimental package for problem solving in robotics.

-------------------------------------------------------

This project was intended as a collection of motion
planning programs for robotics but as many times before
contains completely unrelated programs such as network
embedding based on SAT.



-------------------------------------------------------

Trivia:
I had no idea how to call this project. realX is just
some nearly random name.

-------------------------------------------------------

Please enjoy your robotic problem solving...
